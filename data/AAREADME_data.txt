The rss_ringoccs/data/ directory contains Cassini RSS raw data files 
harvested from NASA's PDS Atmospheres Node, using the same directory 
structure as on the https://pds-atmospheres.nmsu.edu website. 

Note that the GitHub repository itself does not host the actual data files.
They are automatically downloaded from the PDS using scripts within the
rss_ringoccs end-to-end pipeline processing steps.

Examples:
rss_ringoccs/data/cors_0105/sroc1_123/rsr/s10sroe2005123_0740nnnk34rd.1b2
rss_ringoccs/data/local/ <-- any local data not from the PDS should go here
