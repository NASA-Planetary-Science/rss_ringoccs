 *  Purpose:                                                                  *
 *      Contains tools for manipulating floating point variables for          *
 *      platforms using the IEEE754 format (most do in 2021). All of this is  *
 *      experimental and mostly for the sake of learning, and is not directly *
 *      required for rss_ringoccs. Uses of this header file include accurate  *
 *      and fast logarithmic functions, square roots, and more.               *
 *  NOTES:                                                                    *
 *      While the code is written in ANSI C, this is NOT portable since it    *
 *      assumes various things. This part of the code makes the following     *
 *      assumptions (however, as stated, this code is not used for the        *
 *      primary diffraction correction routines):                             *
 *          1.) Your platform uses IEEE754 format for floating point          *
 *              arithmetic. Most modern computers do.                         *
 *          2.) You have 32-bit float and 64-bit double. This is NOT          *
 *              required by the C89/C90 standard, only minimum sizes are      *
 *              specified. 32-bit/64-bit single and double precision is the   *
 *              most common, but this can break portability.                  *
 *          2.) And unsigned long int has 64-bits, and an unsigned int has    *
 *              32-bits. This will most likely NOT be true on 32-bit systems, *
 *              especially 32-bit Microsoft Windows machines where unsigned   *
 *              long int is 32-bit. This assumption is true for 64-bit        *
 *              computers, including all of those rss_ringoccs was tested on. *
 *      Endianness shouldn't matter, however the code has only been tested on *
 *      Little Endian systems.                                                *
