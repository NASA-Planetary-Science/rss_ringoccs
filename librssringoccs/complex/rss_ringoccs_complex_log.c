 *  Purpose:                                                                  *
 *      Contains the source code for the complex log function. If             *
 *      rss_ringoccs was built with C99 complex.h support, this function is   *
 *      not compiled and instead rssringoccs_Complex_Log is just an alias for *
 *      the clog function. By default rss_ringoccs builds with C89 (commonly  *
 *      called ANSI C) support, so this file will be a part of the build.     *

 *  1.) rss_ringoccs_math.h:                                                  *
 *          This file provides compatibility between the two standard math.h  *
 *          header files (C89 vs C99 math.h). If C99 math.h exists, it simply *
 *          provides aliases for the functions, and if C89 math.h is used     *
 *          it defines the functions missing in the earlier version.          *
 *  2.) rss_ringoccs_complex.h:                                               *
 *          Header file where rssringoccs_ComplexDouble is defined, as well   *
 *          as the prototype for rssringoccs_Complex_Log.                     *
 ******************************************************************************
 *                                 WARNINGS                                   *
 *  1.) This function implicitly uses the atan2 function via the              *
 *      rssringoccs_Complex_Argument function. Because of this the branch cut *
 *      for the complex log occurs along the negative x-axis. No option is    *
 *      provided to choose different branches. One can artificially change    *
 *      the branch by adding a multiple of 2 pi to the imaginary part.        *
