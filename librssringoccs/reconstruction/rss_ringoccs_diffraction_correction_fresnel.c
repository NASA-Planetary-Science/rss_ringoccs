 *             Approximate the Fresnel kernel using Legendre polynomials.     *
 *          Newton-Raphson Method:                                            *
 *              Performs the Fresnel Transform by computing the stationary    *
 *              value of the Fresnel Kernel using the Newton-Raphson method.  *
 *          Simple FFT Method:                                                *
 *              Uses an FFT to compute the Fresnel transform. This assumes    *
 *              the geometry about the center of the data set is an accurate  *
 *              representative of the entire occultation. Hence the method is *
 *              accurate around the center and inaccurate towards the edges.  *

 *      Where T_hat is the diffracted data, w is the window function, r is    *
 *      the ring intercept point, and r_0 is a dummy variable of integration. *
 *      psi is the Fresnel Kernel, and exp is the exponential function. The   *
 *      scale factor F is the Fresnel scale which is dependent on the         *
 *      geometry of the occultation.                                          *

 *      For near-constant geometry, or regions where the geometry does not    *
 *      depend heavily on phi, psi is approximately a function of the form    *
 *      psi(rho,rho_0) = f(rho-rho_0) and so this integral is a convolution   *
 *      of w * exp(-i psi) and T_hat. Using the convolution theorem, we get:  *

 *  The Normalization Scheme:                                                 *
 *      As the resolution get's too high, say 10 km or larger, the window     *
 *      width quickly shrinks to zero and the integral will be approximately  *
 *      zero. To account for this, the option to normalize the integral by    *
 *      the window width is offered. The normalization is defined as follows: *
 *                                                                            *

 *                    |    |    exp(-i psi(x)) dx |                           *
 *                    |  | |                      |                           *
 *                    |   -  -infinity            |                           *
 *          Norm =  __________________________________                        *
 *                  |    -  +W/2                    |                         *
 *                  |   | |                         |                         *
 *                  |   |    w(x) exp(-i psi(x)) dx |                         *
 *                  | | |                           |                         *

 *      This has the effect of making the free-space regions, which are       *
 *      regions that are not affected by diffraction, evaluate to one,        *
 *      regardless of what (positive) resolution was chosen.                  *

 ******************************************************************************
 *  It is anticipated that many users of this code will have experience in    *
 *  either Python or IDL, but not C. Many comments are left to explain as     *
 *  much as possible. Vagueness or unclear code should be reported to:        *

 ******************************************************************************
 *                          A NOTE ON CONVENTIONS                             *
 ******************************************************************************
 *  1.) i is a complex number, we'll use n for indexing. Max index values for *
 *      a for loop or while loop should be either capital N, or preferrably   *
 *      a variable name describing what this limit is. i.e. if it's the size  *
 *      of an array, call it arr_size.                                        *
 *  2.) Do not cast malloc. While this is required in C++, it is not in C and *
 *      the official documentation even frowns upon it. That is, do this:     *
 *          double *ptr;                                                      *
 *          long N;                                                           *
 *          ...                                                               *
 *          ptr = malloc(sizeof(*ptr) * N);                                   *
 *      and not:                                                              *
 *          ptr = (double *)malloc(sizeof(*ptr) * N);                         *
 *      malloc returns a void pointer and this is automatically and safely    *
 *      promoted to whatever the type of ptr is.                              *
 *  3.) While not frowned upon, the following makes maintenance easier.       *
 *      Instead of using malloc like (for a pointer to a double):             *
 *          ptr = malloc(sizeof(double) * N);                                 *
 *      Use:                                                                  *
 *          ptr = malloc(sizeof(*ptr) * N);                                   *
 *  4.) Declare variables towards the top of the code and not inside a for    *
 *      loop. It's extremely ugly. The following is good:                     *
 *          long k;                                                           *
 *          long N = 100;                                                     *
 *          for (k=0; k<N; ++k)                                               *
 *              do stuff                                                      *
 *      And this looks horrid:                                                *
 *          long N = 100;                                                     *
 *          for (long k=0; k<N; ++k)                                          *
 *              do stuff                                                      *
 *  5.) If a number is needed in a for loop, even once, declare or set it as  *
 *      a macro, rather than having the number verbatim in the loop. If the   *
 *      the number needs to change it's easier to keep track this way.        *

 *  Function:                                                                 *
 *      DiffractionCorrectionFresnel                                          *
 *  Purpose:                                                                  *
 *      Compute the Fresnel transform using the classic Fresnel quadratic     *
 *      approximation to the Fresnel kernel.                                  *
 *  Arguments:                                                                *
 *      dlp (DLPObj *):                                                       *
 *          An instance of the DLPObj structure defined in                    *
 *          rss_ringoccs_diffraction_correction.h. This contains all of the   *
 *          necessary data for diffraction correction, including the geometry *
 *          of the occultation and actual power and phase data.               *
 *  Output:                                                                   *
 *      Nothing (void):                                                       *
 *          This is a void function, so no actual output is provided. However *
 *          the T_out pointer within the dlp structure will be changed at the *
 *          end, containing the diffraction corrected data.                   *
 *  Notes:                                                                    *
 *      1.) This code uses the Fresnel approximation which has been known to  *
 *          fail for several different occultations, especially ones of very  *
 *          low angle (small B values). Take this into consideration when     *
 *          performing any analysis.                                          *
 *      2.) While this may be inaccurate for certain occultations, it is      *
 *          immensely fast, capable of processing the entire Rev007 E         *
 *          occultation accurately in less than a second at 1km resolution.   *
