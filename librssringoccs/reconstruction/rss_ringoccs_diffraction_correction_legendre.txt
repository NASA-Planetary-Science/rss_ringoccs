 *  Function:                                                                 *
 *      DiffractionCorrectionLegendre                                         *
 *  Purpose:                                                                  *
 *      Compute the Fresnel transform using Legendre polynomials to           *
 *      approximate the fresnel kernel.                                       *
 *  Arguments:                                                                *
 *      dlp (DLPObj *):                                                       *
 *          An instance of the DLPObj structure defined in                    *
 *          _diffraction_correction.h. This contains all of the necessary    *
 *          data for diffraction correction, including the geometry of the    *
 *          occultation and actual power and phase data.                      *
 *  Output:                                                                   *
 *      Nothing (void):                                                       *
 *          This is a void function, so no actual output is provided. However *
 *          the T_out pointer within the dlp structure will be changed at the *
 *          end, containing the diffraction correction data.                  *
 *  Notes:                                                                    *
 *      1.) This routine allows for any selection of polynomial of degree     *
 *          greater than or equal to 2, though for degree 2 it is better to   *
 *          use the Fresnel option since the symmetry nearly doubles the      *
 *          speed of the computation. For anything higher than degree 8 there *
 *          is no real change in the accuracy, even for low inclination       *
 *          occultation observations.                                         *
 *      2.) Like the Fresnel approximation, the Legendre approximation has    *
 *          issues reconstructing data at low B angles. This is because the   *
 *          Legendre approximation assumes the first iteration of the Newton  *
 *          Raphson method is good enough, whereas in reality 3-4 iterations  *
 *          may be needed, like in Rev133.                                    *
