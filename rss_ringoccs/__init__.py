        This program is part of the rss_ringoccs repository hosted at
        https://github.com/NASA-Planetary-Science/rss_ringoccs and developed
        with the financial support of NASA's Cassini Mission to Saturn.

    Purpose:
        Provide tools for analysis of ring occultation experiments,
        particularly those pertaining to the `Cassini Radio Science
        Experiment <https://pds-rings.seti.org/cassini/rss/>`_,
        based on methods from [MTR1986]_ and [CRSUG2018]_. This software
        package contains methods for reading and extracting RSR data,
        computing occultation geometry, calibrating RSR data, and
        performing diffraction reconstruction for calibrated data at
        different resolutions. Also included are tools for writing
        and reading the data products output by the software.
