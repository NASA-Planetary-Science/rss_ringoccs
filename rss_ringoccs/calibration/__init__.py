"""
    Purpose:
        Provide tools for calibrating raw radio science data by
        phase-correcting the measured complex signal and fitting
        the free-space power, as discussed in [MTR1986]_ and [CRSUG2018]_.
        Final calibrated signal can be used to compute the diffraction-
        limited profile of the occultation.

    Dependencies:
        #. numpy
        #. scipy
        #. sys
        #. pdb
        #. matplotlib
