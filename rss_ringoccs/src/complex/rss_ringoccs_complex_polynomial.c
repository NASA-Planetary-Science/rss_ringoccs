 *  Purpose:                                                                  *
 *      Efficiently compute polynomials of a complex variable using Horner's  *
 *      method. Two functions are provided allowing for real coefficients and *
 *      complex coefficients.                                                 *

 *          The standard C library for input and output. This is needed for   *
 *          the "puts" function for printing error messages should the        *
 *          program fail.                                                     *
 *  2.) stdlib:                                                               *
 *          The C standard library header file. This contains the "exit"      *
 *          function which is used to terminate a program if an error occurs. *

 *          Header file where rssringoccs_ComplexDouble is defined, as well   *

 ******************************************************************************
 *                                 WARNINGS                                   *
 *  1.) These functions use "exit" to abort a computation if an error occurs. *
 *      This is to prevent the possibility of a segmentation fault, which     *
 *      often prints out a less-than-helpful error message. Improper use of   *
 *      this function will cause your program to crash (However, the error    *
 *      message will tell you why).                                           *
