"""
Purpose:
    Provides multiple miscellaneous tools for data input/output,
    reconstructing objects, and converting information formats.
    Some are used by multiple object classes within `rss_ringoccs`
    while others are standalone scripts. See the User's Guide
    for details on which scripts the user might call directly.

    Most relevant to the user is the `ExtractCSVData`, which serves
    a critical role in starting the QuickLook rendition of the
    processing pipeline.
