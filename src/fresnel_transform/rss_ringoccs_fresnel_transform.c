 *  Function:                                                                 *
 *      Fresnel_Transform_Double / Fresnel_Transform_Norm_Double              *
 *  Purpose:                                                                  *
 *      Perform diffraction correction on diffraction limited data using the  *
 *      classic Fresnel quadratic approximation to the Fresnel kernel.        *
 *  Arguments:                                                                *
 *      x_arr (double *):                                                     *
 *          Defined as pi/2 (rho-rho0)^2, where rho is the ring radius of     *
 *          the point being reconstructed, and rho0 is the dummy variable of  *
 *          integration which varies from rho-W/2 to zero, W being the        *
 *          window width. This should point to n_pts number of elements.      *
 *      T_in (char *):                                                        *
 *          The diffracted data. Must contain at least n_pts (see below)      *
 *          points to the left and right of the starting point, or a          *
 *          segmentation fault will occur. This error check check is perform  *
 *          when the function is called in _diffraction_functions.c, as well  *
 *          as in the Python DiffractionCorrection class found in             *
 *          diffraction_correction.py.                                        *
 *      w_func (double *):                                                    *
 *          The window/tapering function, as a function of x_arr. This should *
 *          point to n_pts number of elements.                                *
 *      F (double):                                                           *
 *          The Fresnel scale at rho.                                         *
 *      dx (double):                                                          *
 *          The sample spacing, equivalent to x_arr[1] - x_arr[0].            *
 *      n_pts (long):                                                         *
 *          Half the number of points in the window width. The symmetry of    *
 *          the quadratic approximation allows one to perform the inversion   *
 *          with only half of the window. This saves a lot of computation.    *
 *      T_in_steps (long):                                                    *
 *          The number of steps in memory of the nth point to the (n+1)th     *
 *          point in the T_in pointer.                                        *
 *  Outputs:                                                                  *
 *      T_out (complex double):                                               *
 *          The diffraction corrected profile.                                *
