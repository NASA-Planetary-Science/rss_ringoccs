 *  Purpose:                                                                  *
 *      Runs an error check on a rssringoccs_TAUObj pointer.                  *
 *  Arguments:                                                                *

 *          A pointer to a rssringoccs_TAUObj.                                *
 *  Output:                                                                   *
 *      None (void).                                                          *
 *  Method:                                                                   *
 *      Check the relevant members to see if they are NULL.                   *
 *  NOTES:                                                                    *
 *      1.) This function sets the tau->error_occured Boolean to true on      *
 *          error. It is the user's responsibility to check that this Boolean *
 *          is false after using this function. Trying to access the pointers *
 *          in a rssringoccs_TAUObj may result in a segmentation fault        *
 *          otherwise.                                                        *
 *      2.) This function is called by all of the diffraction correction      *
 *          routines at the start as a safety net for avoiding segmentation   *
 *          faults from occuring and crashing the program.                    *

 ******************************************************************************
 *  It is anticipated that many users of this code will have experience in    *
 *  either Python or IDL, but not C. Many comments are left to explain as     *
 *  much as possible. Vagueness or unclear code should be reported to:        *

 *                            A FRIENDLY WARNING                              *
 ******************************************************************************
 *  This code is compatible with the C89/C90 standard. The setup script that  *
 *  is used to compile this in config_librssringoccs.sh uses gcc and has the  *
 *  -pedantic and -std=c89 flags to check for compliance. If you edit this to *
 *  use C99 features (built-in complex, built-in booleans, C++ style comments *
 *  and etc.), or GCC extensions, you will need to edit the config script.    *
