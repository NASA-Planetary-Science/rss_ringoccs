 *      None (void).                                                          *
 *  Method:                                                                   *
 *      Malloc memory for the members of the rssringoccs_TAUObj pointer and   *
 *      loop through the indices copying the values from the                  *
 *      rssringoccs_DLPObj pointer.                                           *
 *  NOTES:                                                                    *
 *      1.) This function sets the tau->error_occured Boolean to true on      *
 *          error. It is the user's responsibility to check that this Boolean *
 *          is false after using this function. Trying to access the pointers *
 *          in a rssringoccs_TAUObj may result in a segmentation fault        *
 *          otherwise.                                                        *
 *      2.) The tau object does NOT steal the reference to the pointers in    *
 *          the dlp pointer. Destroying the tau object does NOT free the      *
 *          memory in the dlp object, and vice-versa. To avoid memory leaks   *
 *          one must destroy both the dlp and tau objects when done with them.*
