    "# Full End-to-End Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial goes through the code of an end-to-end script for rev7E K34, and describes what each part of the code does. The only two parts with human interaction are the frequency calibration GUI and the power calibration GUI. To follow along, go into the pipeline directory and type in:\n",

    "## Importing the rss_ringoccs package\n",
    "\n",
    "To import the package, just include the base directory and import it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sys.path.append('..')\n",
    "import rss_ringoccs as rss\n",
    "sys.path.remove('..')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to import the routines to save the four types of data files separately:\n",

    "## Finding and Entering an RSR file and Kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of code in the script specifying the RSR file and kernel locations looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "rsr_file_name = 's10sroe2005123_0740nnnk34rd.1b2'\n",
    "rsr_file_pds_dir = 'co-s-rss-1-sroc1-v10/cors_0105/sroc1_123/rsr/'\n",
    "rsr_file_local_dir = \"../data/\" + rsr_file_pds_dir\n",
    "kernels_list_file = '../tables/rev007_list_of_kernels.txt'\n",
    "kernels_dir = '../kernels/'\n",
    "kernels = '../tables/Rev007_meta_kernel.ker'\n",
    "rev_number = '007'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### RSR File\n",
    "\n",
    "All RSR files are located at https://atmos.nmsu.edu/pdsd/archive/data/. When you go there, you will see a huge list of directories. The radio science data directories are `co-s-rss-1-sroc*-v10/`. The first two lines in here defining the __rsr_file_name__ and __rsr_file_pds_dir__ variables specify where the file is on this website. The __rsr_file_local_dir__ variable tells where to save this file on to your local machine. We recommend you keep the latter as is. In the last line of this block, we define __rev_number__, which is the orbit number of the occultation. There's a table listing the rev number for each Radio Science Receiver (RSR) file . In the text file `../tables/RSSActivities_before_USOfailure_rings_only.txt`, the first three numbers right after \"RSS\\_\" at the beginning of each row are the rev number for that year and day of year (DOY). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "The __kernels_list_file__ variable is a text file listing all kernels needed for the occultation. A shell script accepts this text file as input, then looks online for these kernels and saves them in a specified directory. In most cases, you can set this to the string `../tables/list_of_kernels.txt`, which covers all occultations. The __kernels_dir__ variable specifies what directory to save this list of kernels in. We recommend you leave the latter as is. The __kernels__ variable is a kernel that encompasses multiple kernel files. In most cases, you can leave this as `../tables/Sa-TC17-V001.ker`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Downloading RSR file and Kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "The following block of code uses a pair of shell scripts to download the specified RSR file and kernels:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Downloading RSR files...\")\n",
    "os.system('./get_rsr_file.sh %s %s %s ; echo \"RSR Complete\"' %\n",
    "          (rsr_file_name, rsr_file_pds_dir, rsr_file_local_dir))\n",
    "print(\"Downloading kernels...\")\n",
    "os.system('./get_kernels.sh %s %s ; echo \"Kernels Complete\"' %\n",
    "          (kernels_list_file, kernels_dir))\n",
    "rsr_file = rsr_file_local_dir + rsr_file_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first `os.system` command uses the shell script to download the RSR file, and the second one uses the shell script to download the kernels.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Specifying Output Files and Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "All output files and the output directory are specified by the following block of code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "output_directory = '../output/rev7E_K34_e2e_output/'\n",
    "freq_offset_file = output_directory + 'freq_offset_file.txt'\n",
    "f_resid_fit_parameters_file = output_directory + 'f_resid_fit_parameters.p'\n",
    "power_norm_fit_parameters_file = (\n",
    "    output_directory + 'power_norm_fit_parameters.p'\n",
    ")\n",
    "geo_file = 'RSS_2005_123_K34_E_GEO'\n",
    "cal_file = 'RSS_2005_123_K34_E_CAL'\n",
    "dlp_file = 'RSS_2005_123_K34_E_DLP'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The __output_directory__ variable just tells the code where to save all the output files. __freq_offset_file__ is the full path of a file in which to save calculated frequency offset, __f_resid_fit_parameters_file__ is the full path name of a pickle file in which to save the frequency calibration fit parameters, __power_norm_fit_parameters_file__ is the full path name of a pickle file in which to save the power calibration fit parameters, and the remaining three are the names of three of the four types of data files that are saved. Note that the routines that save these files will add an underscore, the current date in YYYYMMDD format, and \".TAB\" for the data file and \".LBL\" for the corresponding label file. __Specifying any of these files is not strictly necessary to running the pipeline.__\n",
    "\n",
    "## Specifying USO Frequency and Diffraction Correction Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Below the chunk of code specifying output files and directory, you will see:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f_USO = 8427222034.34050 * 3.8\n",
    "dr_km_desired = 0.25\n",
    "res_km = 1.0\n",
    "inversion_range = [87410, 87610]\n",

    "verbose = True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In order, these variables specify:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __f_USO__ - USO frequency, which is necessary for the frequency calibration step. The number given in this case (8427222034.34050 \\* 3.8) is for Ka band. Drop the factor of 3.8 for X band (8427222034.34050), and multiply the X band value by 3/11 for S band (8427222034.34050 \\* (3/11)).\n",
    "* __dr_km_desired__ - The radial spacing to resample to when transferring to uniformly spaced radius right before diffraction correction.\n",
    "* __res_km__ - the radial resolution at which the script does diffraction correction, which can't be any lower than twice dr_km_desired.\n",
    "* inversion_range - Range over which to do diffraction correction. Usually want to make this about [70000, 150000] if you're saving the data files.\n",
    "* __tau_file__ - Name of teh fourth type of data file to save. Adds the same set of information as the geo_file, cal_file, and dlp_file above.\n",
    "* __verbose__ - Boolean variable to specify whether or not to print out intermediate steps and results. It's set to True right now for the purpose of demonstration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions to Read and Write Pickle Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Below the definitions of USO frequency and diffraction correction parameters, you will see four functions defined. The `read_f_resid_fit_parameters` and `write_f_resid_fit_parameters` functions read and write the frequency calibration fit parameters, while the `read_power_norm_fit_parameters` and `write_power_norm_fit_parameters` functions read and write the power calibration fit parameters. These are used later on in the script.\n",

    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line defining __rsr_inst__ reads the Radio Science Receiver file specified by the __rsr_file__ variable. The second line retrieves a dictionary with a set of information about the occultation. __This second line is not strictly necessary to run the pipeline, since it is only used when saving the data files.__ The third line defining __geo_inst__ calculates the occultation geometry over the full time range in the RSR file.\n",

    "To see how to use the data files to redo diffraction correction without redoing the calibration steps, see the script __Rev007EK34_quick_look.py__. You will need to replace the `geo_file`, `cal_file`, and `dlp_file` variables with the names of your output from the __Rev007EK34_e2e.py__ script outlined in the rest of this tutorial. To see different ring features at different processing resolutions, play with the `res_km` and `inversion_range` variables. The only two things you need from the `rss_ringoccs` package when using the data files are `rss_ringoccs.tools.ExtractCSVData` and `rss_ringoccs.diffcorr.DiffractionCorrection`."
