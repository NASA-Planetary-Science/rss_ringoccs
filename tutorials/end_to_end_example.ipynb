    "\n",
    "This tutorial goes through the code of an end-to-end script for rev7E K34, and describes what each part of the code does. The only two parts with human interaction are the frequency calibration GUI and the power calibration GUI. To follow along, go into the pipeline directory and type in:\n",

    "## Importing the rss_ringoccs package\n",
    "\n",
    "To import the package, just include the base directory and import it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sys.path.append('..')\n",
    "import rss_ringoccs as rss\n",
    "sys.path.remove('..')\n",

    "You need to import the routines to save the four types of data files separately:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sys.path.append('../rss_ringoccs/tools')\n",
    "from pds3_geo_series import write_geo_series\n",

    "## Finding and Entering an RSR file and Kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of code in the script specifying the RSR file and kernel locations looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "rsr_file_name = 's10sroe2005123_0740nnnk34rd.1b2'\n",
    "rsr_file_pds_dir = 'co-s-rss-1-sroc1-v10/cors_0105/sroc1_123/rsr/'\n",
    "rsr_file_local_dir = \"../data/\" + rsr_file_pds_dir\n",
    "kernels_list_file = '../tables/rev007_list_of_kernels.txt'\n",
    "kernels_dir = '../kernels/'\n",
    "kernels = '../tables/Rev007_meta_kernel.ker'\n",
    "rev_number = '007'\n",
    "occultation_direction = 'Egress'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### RSR File\n",
    "\n",
    "All RSR files are located at https://atmos.nmsu.edu/pdsd/archive/data/. When you go there, you will see a huge list of directories. The radio science data directories are `co-s-rss-1-sroc*-v10/`. The first two lines in here defining the __rsr_file_name__ and __rsr_file_pds_dir__ variables specify where the file is on this website. The __rsr_file_local_dir__ variable tells where to save this file on to your local machine. We recommend you keep the latter as is. In the second-to-last line of this block, we define __rev_number__, which is the orbit number of the occultation. In the text file `../tables/RSSActivities_before_USOfailure_rings_only.txt`, the first three numbers right after \"RSS\\_\" at the beginning of each row are the rev number for that year and day of year (DOY). __occultation_direction__ specifies what direction the occultation is going in (your choices are \"Egress\", \"Ingress\", or \"Chord\").\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "The __kernels_list_file__ variable is a text file listing all kernels needed for the occultation. A shell script accepts this text file as input, then looks online for these kernels and saves them in a specified directory. In most cases, you can set this to the string `../tables/list_of_kernels.txt`, which covers all occultations. The __kernels_dir__ variable specifies what directory to save this list of kernels in. We recommend you leave the latter as is. The __kernels__ variable is a kernel that encompasses multiple kernel files. In most cases, you can leave this as `../tables/Sa-TC17-V001.ker`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Downloading RSR file and Kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "The following block of code uses a pair of shell scripts to download the specified RSR file and kernels:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Downloading RSR files...\")\n",
    "os.system('./get_rsr_file.sh %s %s %s ; echo \"RSR Complete\"' %\n",
    "          (rsr_file_name, rsr_file_pds_dir, rsr_file_local_dir))\n",
    "print(\"Downloading kernels...\")\n",
    "os.system('./get_kernels.sh %s %s ; echo \"Kernels Complete\"' %\n",
    "          (kernels_list_file, kernels_dir))\n",
    "rsr_file = rsr_file_local_dir + rsr_file_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first `os.system` command uses the shell script to download the RSR file, and the second one uses the shell script to download the kernels. You may also choose to run these shell scripts before running the Python script.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Specifying Output Files and Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "All output files and the output directory are specified by the following block of code:\n",

    "* __freq_offset_file__ - The full path of a file in which to save calculated frequency offset\n",
    "* __f_resid_fit_parameters_file__ - The full path name of a pickle file in which to save the frequency calibration fit parameters. Fit parameters saved are free-space regions in SPM and polynomial fit order\n",
    "* __power_norm_fit_parameters_file__ - The full path name of a pickle file in which to save the power calibration fit parameters. Fit parameters saved are free-space regions in SPM, knots of the spline fit in SPM, and spline fit order\n",
    "* __geo_file__ - Name of data file containing geometry information, and its corresponding label file\n",
    "* __cal_file__ - Name of data file containing calibration information, and its corresponding label file\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that the routines that save the last three files will add an underscore, the current date in YYYYMMDD format, and \".TAB\" for the data file and \".LBL\" for the corresponding label file. __Specifying any of these files is not strictly necessary to running the pipeline.__\n",
    "\n",
    "## Specifying USO Frequency and Diffraction Correction Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Below the chunk of code specifying output files and directory, you will see:\n",

    "* __dr_km_desired__ - The radial spacing to resample to when transferring to uniformly spaced radius right before diffraction correction.\n",
    "* __res_km__ - the radial resolution at which the script does diffraction correction, which can't be any lower than twice dr_km_desired.\n",
    "* __inversion_range__ - Range over which to do diffraction correction. Usually want to make this about [70000, 150000] if you're saving the data files.\n",
    "* __tau_file__ - Name of the fourth type of data file to save. Adds the same set of information as the geo_file, cal_file, and dlp_file above.\n",
    "* __verbose__ - Boolean variable to specify whether or not to print out intermediate steps and results. It's set to True right now for the purpose of demonstration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions to Read and Write Pickle Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Below the definitions of USO frequency and diffraction correction parameters, you will see four functions defined. The `read_f_resid_fit_parameters` and `write_f_resid_fit_parameters` functions read and write the frequency calibration fit parameters, while the `read_power_norm_fit_parameters` and `write_power_norm_fit_parameters` functions read and write the power calibration fit parameters. These are used later on in the script. All four functions require importing the pickle module (```import pickle```)\n",

You will need to replace the `geo_file`, `cal_file`, and `dlp_file` variables with the names of your output from the __Rev007EK34_e2e.py__ script outlined in the rest of this tutorial. To see different ring features at different processing resolutions, play with the `res_km` and `inversion_range` variables. The only two things you need from the `rss_ringoccs` package when using the data files are `rss_ringoccs.tools.ExtractCSVData` and `rss_ringoccs.diffcorr.DiffractionCorrection`."
